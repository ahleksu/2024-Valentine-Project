          Hi love! I know I might be too late to ask you to be my valentine, but I just want to say <b>thank you for everything</b>. And, I wanted to express to you how much I am by making this. It is actually my first time making this and I hope you liked it hehe inspo from TikTok. For this year's hearts day, I want you to know that you are my <b>greatest love</b>. You are the one that made me feel wanted despite my every flaw and stayed with me through hardships and successes. I am always captivated and smitten by your presence. You are my <b>fatal flaw</b>. And in the books I'm reading, it means <b>you ground me to life</b>. You are my <b>weakness and strength</b>. <b>My Achilles' heel</b>. You hold a <b>power</b> that can put me down and bring me back to life. Thank you for being in it. <b>I look forward to be with you for a lifetime</b>.
